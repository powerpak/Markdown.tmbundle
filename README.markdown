# Markdown.tmbundle

Markdown settings for use with TextMate 2.

## What's different?

Note this is a delta bundle, based off of [the original](https://github.com/textmate/markdown.tmbundle).  Why not release a whole bundle?  I'd rather just add my commands and changes to what's current.

## Usage

1. Close TextMate 2.
2. Checkout into `~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles`.
3. Double click on the Markdown.tmbundle that was made to open it in Textmate 2.
4. Textmate will complain that the bundle is in delta format.  No matter; it will still work.  You can verify this by going to Bundles > Edit Bundles... and checking that the Markdown bundle has `Convert To LaTeX (pandoc)` and other various Menu Actions.
